# Sudoku
A simple Sudoku game, that requests and renders the numbers from https://sugoku.herokuapp.com. 
For now the code only takes input from the user.

# Future Upgrades
The code will have the ability to check for wrong inputs and allow only a total of three errors.
It should have the ability to give hints and scores based on time.
Finally, implement a Machine Learning Model to solve each Soduku.
